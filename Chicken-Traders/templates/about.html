    <h1 class="h1">Welcome to chicken traders, <strong>{{game.player.name}}</strong>!</h1>
    <p>One regular day on the farm, you were wandering around doing whatever chickens do. Suddenly, reality hit
        hard!
        Maybe this isn't the life you wanted to live after all. You've always wanted to be a <strong>CHICKEN
            TRADER</strong>!!
    </p><br /><br />
    <h1 class="h1">Main Objective:</h1>
    <p>Earn credits mainly by buying items and reselling them at a higher cost. Regions may pay a premium for
        certain types of items and higher tech goods. Once you're rich enough, find and <strong>BUY THE
            UNIVERSE</strong>!
    </p><br />
    <img id='image' src='../static/buylowsellhigh.png'>
    <p>Be wary of the dangers lurking beyond the comfort of the farms and the uncertainty of the market! <strong>Be
            safe out there, young one!</strong></p><br /><br />
