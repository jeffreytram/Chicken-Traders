    <h1>Welcome to chicken traders, {{game.player.name}}!</h1>
    <p>On a regular day on the farm, you were wandering around doing whatever chickens do. Suddenly, reality hit hard!
        Maybe this isn't the life I wanted to live after all. I've always wanted to be a <strong>CHICKEN
            TRADER</strong>!!
    </p><br />
    <h2>Main Objective:</h2>
    <p>Earn credits mainly by buying items and reselling them at a higher cost. Once you're rich enough, find and
        <strong>BUY THE UNIVERSE</strong>!</p><br />
    <p>Be wary of the dangers lurking beyond the comfort of the farms and the uncertainty of the market! <strong>Be safe
            out there, young one!</strong></p><br /><br />
